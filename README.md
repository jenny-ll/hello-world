# hello-world
first repository

i'm jenny! i currently study econ at ubc, but recently i've discovered a new passion for programming. i enjoy the problem-solving and logic that comes with programming. i took on programming because i felt like something was missing from my current university degree. i hope to improve my programming skills because i enjoy creating new things and making ideas come to life, rather than always having to analyze data. i currently most enjoy coming up with strategies, but i am learning to hone my ability to implement - ie, my ability to code.

i hope that one day, i can utilize my passion for innovation along with my programming skills + econ/business background to contribute to a greater cause. :)
